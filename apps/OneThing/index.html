    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="meta"><strong>OneThing</strong><br />
      <strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2025
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>OneThing is a daily focus tracker for iOS and Apple Watch. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the app handles and how it is stored.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>OneThing does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.</strong> The app has no servers, no analytics, no third-party SDKs, and no advertising.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>OneThing stores the following data locally on your device using UserDefaults and App Group shared storage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daily focus text</strong> — the focus you set each day</li>
      <li><strong>Focus history</strong> — past focuses with dates, completion status, and optional reflection notes</li>
      <li><strong>Gamification state</strong> — XP, level, streak count, and streak freeze inventory</li>
      <li><strong>App preferences</strong> — notification settings, animation intensity, haptics preference</li>
      <li><strong>Notification schedule</strong> — your chosen morning reminder and evening nudge times</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export or share it.</p>

    <h2>Apple Watch</h2>
    <p>If you use the Apple Watch companion app, your focus state is synced between your iPhone and Apple Watch using Apple's WatchConnectivity framework. This is a direct, local connection between your paired devices — no data passes through external servers.</p>

    <h2>Home Screen Widget</h2>
    <p>The Home Screen and watch face widgets read your focus state from shared on-device storage (App Group). No network requests are made.</p>

    <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>OneThing includes optional iCloud sync capability using Apple's iCloud key-value storage. When enabled, your focus history and gamification state sync across your devices through your personal iCloud account. This data is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's iCloud privacy policy</a>. No data is sent to any other server.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>OneThing can send local notifications (morning reminder and evening nudge). These are scheduled entirely on your device. No push notification service or external server is involved.</p>

    <h2>CSV Export</h2>
    <p>You can export your focus history as a CSV file. This file is generated locally and shared only through the iOS share sheet at your discretion. OneThing does not upload or transmit this file.</p>

    <h2>Siri &amp; Shortcuts</h2>
    <p>OneThing supports Siri Shortcuts for setting your focus and marking it complete. Voice processing is handled entirely by Apple's system. OneThing does not access or store any voice data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>OneThing uses <strong>no</strong> third-party services, SDKs, analytics, crash reporting, or advertising frameworks.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>OneThing does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app stores no personal information and has no user accounts.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>All app data can be deleted by removing the app from your device. Since no data is stored on external servers, deletion is immediate and complete.</p>

    <h2>App Store Privacy Labels</h2>
    <p>In accordance with Apple's App Store requirements, OneThing declares:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Not Collected</strong> — OneThing does not collect any data from users</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this policy changes, the updated version will be included with the app and the "Last updated" date above will be revised.</p>
